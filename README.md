The Eclipse SDV Blueprints project is a collaborative initiative led by Eclipse SDV members to bring the software defined vehicle concepts to life.

The project hosts a collection of blueprints that demonstrate the application of technologies developed in the context of the Eclipse SDV Working Group.

This repository contains the digital.auto & AosEdge Blueprint which enables quick seamless prototyping with unified Mixed-Critical Deployment & Orchestration platforms for Virtual & HW environments.

The following diagram provides a high level overview of how digital.auto (Eclipes autowrx) the cloud prototyping environment, AosEdge the mixed-critical deployment and orchestration platform, and other Eclipse Blueprints, Eclipse S-CORE and virtual/HW environments interacts.
